TODO for Isoquery
=================

- BUG
  The codes in ISO 639 are shown twice if 2B and 2T code are
  identical. Examples are vie, swa.
  
- bindtextdomain()

- write a man page

- allow use of ISO 639-3, ISO 3166-2, ISO 15924

- optionally print results with NULL characters instead of newlines

- possibly fix security warnings from scanners like
  flawfinder, rats, and pscan
